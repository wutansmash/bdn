# Clinical Data Standards: Practical Implementation Strategies

## Navigating Product-Team Dynamics

### Building Cross-Product Alignment
1. **Early Engagement Strategy**
   - Map dependencies across product teams
   - Identify shared technical requirements
   - Document common pain points
   - Create shared success metrics

2. **Technical Debt Management**
